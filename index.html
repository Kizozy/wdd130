          Hello, my name is Okeke Kingsley and I am from Nigeria. I am 26 years
          old. I enjoy strategic games, playing guitar, and discovering new music.
          I'm passionate about web development, learning new technologies, and
          collaborating on creative projects. Currently I'm studying front-end
          development and practicing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I build small apps
          to sharpen my skills, contribute to open-source projects, and am
          learning React and Node.js. In my free time I volunteer at local coding
          workshops. I also enjoy photography, hiking, and exploring new cuisines.
          My goals are to become a versatile full-stack developer, create
          accessible and responsive websites, and work on projects that have a
          positive impact. I welcome collaboration and feedback—feel free to
          connect with me through mail and social media.
